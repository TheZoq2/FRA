# Förebyggande Reaktivt Antisärskrivningssystem (FRA)

Things have gone too far and SÄPO is overloaded with the amount of "english
disease" occurring on a daily basis. To combat this FRA will automatically scan
messages for potential "english disease outbreaks" and notify one or more SÄPO
agent about the infraction.

Uses a dictionary from http://runeberg.org/words/ss100.txt, which has been
converted to UTF-8.
